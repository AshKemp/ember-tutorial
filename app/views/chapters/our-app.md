# Our App

I spent some time thinking about what app to build in this tutorial. I want to build something that really shows off Ember. I could do CRUD, sure, but that's not very much fun.

So here's what we're going to build: a website mockup creator in the browser. It's going to be simple enough for this tutorial, but complex enough to show how Ember really shines.

Additionally, a better mockup tool is an itch we've been wanting to scratch at Hashrocket, so I'm using this tutorial to build out an initial version of this mockup tool which may actually be useful.
