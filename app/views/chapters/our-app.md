# Our App

We are going to build a relatively simple CRM. This is a good project for Ember because we'll be listing data, showing records, editing records, and doing other useful things like searching and filtering. If you can build this app and understand how it works then you will be well on your way to developing your own complex front-end apps. You can see the completed version of the app #TODO here to get an idea of what we'll be doing.

The main view of the app looks like this: #TODO app image.

Users can click on a lead to see it.

They can click edit to edit that lead.

They can click cancel to ignore any changes.

They can click save, and records will be saved via ajax.

As you can see, the main object in this sytem is the Lead. This is what we will be focused on manipulating.

## Preparing The App

You can use the Hello World app we built earlier as the base for this app. I'm going to provide you with markup and styles so that you can just focus on the Ember stuff.
