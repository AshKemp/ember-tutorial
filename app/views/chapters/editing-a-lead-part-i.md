# Editing a Lead Part I

There are two places to edit a lead in the app. We have status and notes which are immediately visible on lead show, and we can also click an "edit" link that will let us edit the lead's basic info like name, email, and phone.

Let's start with the status and notes, which will just be additions to our existing lead route and template.

## Add the Status Select

First we need to tell the app about the different statuses a lead can have. The `Lead` model should know about this, so add this code after your `Lead` model in the same file:

```coffee
# app/assets/javascripts/models/lead/js.coffee

App.Lead.reopenClass
  STATUSES: ['new', 'in progress', 'closed', 'bad']
```

You will now be able to get to this array through `App.Lead.STATUSES`.

Open the lead template and add the following to the bottom:

```
/* app/assets/javascripts/templates/lead.js.emblem */
p
  label for=view.status.elementId Status:
  '
  view Ember.Select content=App.Lead.STATUSES value=model.status viewName="status"
```

Ember provides a built in select view which we can use. We point `content` to our status array, and we bind it to the status attribute of the lead model through `value`.

We are also using `viewName=status` to give this view a specific name, which we can then use in the label's `for` attribute in order to give the `for` the correct element id.

## Add the Notes

Add this code after the status select:

```
/* app/assets/javascripts/templates/lead.js.emblem */
p
  label for=view.notes.elementId Notes:
  br
  view Ember.TextArea value=model.notes viewName="notes"
```

Here we use Ember's text area and bind it to `model.notes`. We are using the same `viewName` pattern for the label.

## Add a Submit Button

Here's our submit button:

```
/* app/assets/javascripts/templates/lead.js.emblem */
p
  input type='submit' value='Save Changes' click='saveChanges'
```

The `click` attribute specifies a function to call when you click this button. Ember expects the controller to define this function.

## Save the Record

Now that our form is wired up, we need to make it work.

Create a `LeadController` and add the following code:

```coffee
# app/assets/javascripts/controllers/lead.js.coffee
App.LeadController = Ember.ObjectController.extend

  actions:
    saveChanges: -> @get('model').save()
```

First note that this controller is an `ObjectController`. This is because it is wrapping a single Ember model. If you had an array of models you would use `ArrayController`. And if you had no models would use plain `Controller`.

Our submit button will call the `saveChanges` function. This function must be within `actions` since it is being called from the template. This is an Ember convention to help keep your code organized.

`save()` will actually send an ajax put request to our Rails api, and everything should just work. Try it out in your browser. Edit a record, click "Save Changes", and look at the Network tab in the Chrome console. You should see a put request to `api/v1/leads/{ id of record }`. If you refresh the page the saved record should show your changes.

Saving is that easy! Just bind and call `save()`. It's fun and it's healthy.

## Show Helpful Feedback

Now we're going to get fancy and give the user some nice feedback around saving. When there are unsaved changes, we'll show **unsaved changes**, and when the record is actually saving we'll show **saving...**.

First add these to the template after the submit button:

```
p
  input type='submit' value='Save Changes' click="saveChanges"
  if isDirty
    .unsaved unsaved changes
  if isSaving
    .saving saving...
```

Ember will look in the controller to find `isDirty` and `isSaving`. If the controller doesn't find them it will look in the model. Both `isSaving` and `isDirty` come built-in with `DS.Model`, so we are actually done.

Try it out it in the browser. You should see **unsaved changes** appear in red next to the save button if you add anything to notes or change the status of a lead. Click "save changes" to see **saving...** in green. It will probably appear only briefly -- since you are in development the server is going to be quick.


## Prettifying "Saving..."

We have a little problem here. **unsaved changes** is still visible while you are saving a record. You can see this more easily if you add `sleep 1` to the top of your `update` action in the leads api controller. This is because the record remains dirty until saving is completed, as you would expect. Let's do some work to hide this text while saving.

We'll make a property called `showUnsavedMessage`. Replace `isDirty` with `showUnsavedMessage` in the template:

```
if showUnsavedMessage
  .unsaved unsaved changes
```

Open the controller and add the property:

```coffee
# app/assets/javascripts/controllers/lead.js.coffee
App.LeadController = Ember.ObjectController.extend

  showUnsaved: ( ->
    @get('isDirty') and !@get('isSaving')
  ).property('isDirty', 'isSaving')
```

Now, because programming, the message will disappear when the record is saving.

## Alerting for Fun and Profit

What if you wanted to prompt the user to save changes before switching to a different lead? Here's how you'd do it. I'm not actually keeping this code in my app because I don't like the interaction, but I think it's an interesting exercise that you might want to know how to do.

```coffee
# app/assets/javascripts/routes/lead.js.coffee
contextDidChange: ->
  if lead = @controllerFor('lead').get('model')
    if lead.get('isDirty') and confirm "Do you want to save your changes?"
      lead.save()
    else
      lead.rollback()
```

This is a bit complicated, but here we go:

We're using the `contextDidChange` hook, which is called when the model for the current route changes. We need to get the model we were just editing, but by the time you hit this hook the model for the route has already changed, so we can't get the model with `@modelFor('lead')`. Instead we'll do `@controllerFor('lead').get('model')`, because the controller's model hasn't actually been udpated yet (`contextDidChange` is called before `setupController`).

`contextDidChange` is called when you enter the route the first time too, in which case `@controllerFor('lead')` would be empty, so that's why we have the first if statement. If we find a lead model on the controller, we can then ask if it's dirty. If it's dirty, we then prompt the user to either save their changes, or rollback the record to it's previous state.

We can put the isDirty check and the confirm into a single if statement because if the record is not dirty then rolling back won't do anything.

That's it for editing part one. Upwards and onwards!
