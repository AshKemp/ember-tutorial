# Introduction

## What is Ember JS

Ember is a front-end javascript framework. You would use a front-end framework for the same reasons you
would use a back-end framework. It gives you an organized
structure, conventions, and built-in ways to some of the hard things.

Like Angular, Backbone and Knockout, Ember arrived recently to help
developers build great front-end applications while maintaining a clean code base.

## Why Choose Ember

I can’t speak for every framework out there, but I can tell you what’s great about Ember.

**Logical Code Organization**. If you come from a Rails background you will appreciate
Ember’s naming conventions. For example a Users Controller looks for a Users View and a
Users Template.

**Easy Persistence**. Once you have your back-end communicating with Ember, saving a
record as easy as calling `user.save()`. Want to delete this user?  Call
`user.destroyRecord()`.

**Auto-Updating Templates**. Create a property and display it with `{{ myProperty }}` in your Handlebars template. Any updates will appear instantly. Handlebars might not be much to rave about, but your templates can look pretty darn good if you use [Emblem](http://emblemjs.com), and templating language for Handlebars that's similar to Slim.

**Helpful Object API’s** Ember implments its own set of objects, each of which comes with
a really friendly API. For example Ember has an Array object with methods like `contains`,
`filterBy`, and `sortBy`. These are the things that make your life better.

I think Ember is absolutely worth learning if you find yourself needing to build front-end heavy applications. Ember may seem like a lot, but it's really not that complicated. Once you learn how the various Ember objects interact and get a handle on the basics of the API you'll be coding glorious front-end apps in no time.
